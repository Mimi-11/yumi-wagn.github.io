                <h3>Pepeha of Yumi</h3>
                <p>

                <h3>Identity and Values</h3>
                <p>
                  I would like to consider myself an explorer. The German word "Fernweh" describes my desire to discover a bigger world and experience different things.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Growing up in a small city Nanning and being close to my whƒÅnau, I have developed an enormous love for my hometown and my family. In our culture, we value being around our parents and extended family. But there is also a saying: It is better to travel ten thousand miles than to read ten thousand books. My grandma once told me to study abroad and explore the world when I grow up. She planted the seed in my mind, and now it has grown like a strong tree. I will always stay curious and hungry on my journey to learn new things, embrace different cultures, and discover the world.
                </p>
                <p>The three most important values to me are kindness, respect, and empathy. </p>
                <p>I like to feel how people feel and to understand everyone might be going through something you know nothing about. The open-mindedness and belief in equality have long been embedded in my mind, which require me to treat everyone as equal regardless of their age, gender, race, beliefs, etc. </p>
                <p>When it comes to the ethical decision I made,  I left my previous job due to a coworker's racist speech. The coworker consistently complained about another employee to me in our language with offensive words. It had a huge conflict with my value as what she did was not respectful or nice. If I were the other employee, I definitely do not like to be judged just because of my skin and have offensive words that I couldn't understand against me in my ears. And I found out the coworker wasn't the only one. It made me question the environment of the work as it is where I don't enjoy working even I only worked part-time. I have a nature of running away from things I do not like. So I left the job and started looking for a workplace where is more ethical and inclusive. </p>
                
                <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
                
                <p>My strengths include attention to detail and patience.¬†</p>
                <p>When I worked as an accountant, I liked to get every detail right from the beginning as I knew that it will be a huge workload if we only find out the imbalance¬† at the end. Things will be so messed up by then. It will also require patience because it's easily getting boring and frustrating. And being annoyed won't help anything.¬†
                  I can utilize that in my learning, as I will want to get every code right and work. It required me to do more research and explore new knowledge. I can also understand the common mistake from hands-on practice.¬†
                  I would like to think when I'm getting more and more involved into the study, I will try to manage my time more efficiently to suit my schedule. Also, to get help and support others and develop a reciprocal relationship with my peer students.¬†</p>
                <p>My limitations are communication and time management.¬†</p>
                <p>As an introvert, I am good at spending time and communicate with myself. And so I don't have much practice in communicating and building relationships with others. I would like to use my values to guide me in this through time.¬†
                  What is more, procrastination has been something I have been struggling. Understanding the importance of doing something is a whole different thing than actually doing it. However, I start to get better on it. As a simple rule is to stop overthinking and just do it even the outcome is not the best.</p>
