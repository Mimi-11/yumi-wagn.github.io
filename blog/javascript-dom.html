      <h2>Javascript Fundamentals</h2>
      <h3>¬∑ differences between HTML and CSS</h3>

      <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two important technologies for building
        Web pages. HTML provides the structure of the page, and CSS is in charge of the style and layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        Think HTML as a basic house with the main structure, bricks, concrete walls, staircases, and roof. It functions
        as a shelter but you won‚Äôt be happy living in it.
        CSS acts as a decoration team that designs and decorates the interior and exterior of the house. They also put
        furniture and decoration inside your house to make it beautiful, cozy, and warm.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript is the programming language of the Web. It can help to enhance the user experience interacting with
        web pages. It is like the iPhone Home app, it can turn your rice cooker on through the remote control when you
        are in your office. Or change the airconditioner temperature, turn the lights off, even have your walls
        recolored.
      </p>


      <h3>¬∑Control flow and Loops </h3>
      <p>
        Control flow is like your decision-making on whether to buy a new iPhone 13 or not in a financially efficient
        way. You need to do it step by step to follow it through.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Is your current cellphone still functioning well?</li>
        <li>Do you have enough money?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Your answers to each question will lead to different paths and result in different conclusions. And We also
        need to define ‚Äúfunction‚Äù and ‚Äúenough money‚Äù to come to a decision. We can say if the battery maximum capacity
        is higher than 70%, the phone is still running fine. And the money we need is $1000. So, if the battery is 50%,
        we go to step 2. And unfortunately, we only have $500. Now we can make a decision not to buy the phone 13.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loops are used to run repeated processes until a certain criteria is met. We now want the decision on
        purchasing an iPhone 13 to be yes. And the first condition is met, but not the second one. In order to save up
        the $1000, we need to work harder and have fewer takeaways. And we need to keep doing these until we have the
        $1000 or more in the bank account. 
      </p>
      <h3>¬∑The DOM</h3>
      <p>
        The DOM (Document Object Model) is an application programming interface for web documents. Think about every
        web page as a library with different departments. And there are many sectors inside each department. DOM can be
        seen as a magic machine that can represent the library in a tree structure. It also allows us to have access and
        interact with the library including the department, sectors, and books.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developer tools are used to interact with web pages through a browser. Developers can use it to test and debug
        websites. We can also use the tools to manipulate web pages. Such as changing the background colors, the
        content, and its logo.
      </p>
      <h3>¬∑Arrays and Objects.</h3>
      <p>
        Arrays are used to set up a list of items with order. And the items are within the same category. Say we have
        an array called ‚Äúfruit name‚Äù, in the array we have coconut, watermelon, and peach. The fruits are stored in a
        numbered order and the index starts from 0. So if we want to call out coconut, we use fruit name[0]. Fruit
        name[2] will be peach in the same manner. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are like business cards, we can store different categories of data in each object. For example, we have
        an object/business card call coconut. In the object/business card, the name is coconut. Hometown: Indo-Malaya,
        Genus: Cocos, and Species: Nucifera. We can use strings/names to look for information stored in the object
        instead of the index number.
      </p>
      <h3>¬∑Functions</h3>
      <p>
        Function is a block of code that can be used over and over again. Imagine you are working in a food box factory
        line. You are asked to put ingredients 1, 2, 5 in a box when people ordered meal A. Ingredients 2, 6, 7, 9 for
        meal B. It is tiring and easy to make mistakes. So you decide to program a robot to work for you. When the robot
        sees the meal‚Äôs name, it automatically goes to the ingredients locations accordingly and takes one each. Now you
        can just sit back, have a cup of tea, and watch the robot work for you.
