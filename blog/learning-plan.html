            <h2>Learning Plan</h2>

            <p>¬∑ What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</p>
            <p>The final goal I want to reach is to be an experienced full-stack developer and be good at problem solving. I would like to start as a web designer and learn more from there.</p>
            <p>¬∑ A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.
            </p>
            <p>My strengths include attention to detail and patience.<br  />
              My limitations are communication and time management.  
            </p>
            <p>¬∑ What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</p>
            <p>Communication, stress management, and time manegement.</p>
            <p>¬∑ A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </p>
            <p>Focus on the prioritized tasks and be time-efficient.</p>
            <p>If things start to get to me, I will have a break, clearing my mind. And then come back clarifing things up.</p>
            <p>¬∑ A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way            </p>
            <p>To seek help from my peer students.</p>
            <p>¬∑ A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</p>
            <p>To keep me on the right track. And possibly to have feedbacks and advice from the team.</p>
            <p>¬∑ Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It‚Äôs important to plan these in.</p>
            <p>Not at the moment. But I might work for one or two days a week after lockdown.</p>
