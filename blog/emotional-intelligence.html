            <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
            <h3>¬∑ What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>

            <p>Emotional intelligence (emotional quotient or EQ) in short, is the ability to be aware, understand, and regulate the emotions of oneself. Also to notice and understand the emotions of others.</p>
            <p>Five components of EQ are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Self-awareness</li>
                <li>Self-regulation</li>
                <li>Motivation</li>
                <li>Empathy</li>
                <li>Social skills</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>¬∑ How is it different to IQ?</h3>
            <p>IQ focuses on people's intelligence, critical thinking, problem-solving, calculation ability, logical thinking, etc. While EQ is more of the ability to feel and understand the emotions of oneself and others.</p>
            <h3>¬∑Why is it important?</h3>
            <p>Emotional intelligence can reduce the impact of negative feelings and improve interpersonal relationships.</p>
            <p>Life is hard and things don't always go your way. EQ helps us to cope with negative emotions and provides the energy to overcome difficulties in life.</p>
            <p>Knowing and caring for people's feelings and emotions is also essential to build and maintain relationships with others. EQ is a critical human skill to maintain healthy relationships with people in our lives.</p>
