            <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
            <h3>¬∑ The problem I encountered</h3>

            <p>
                The problem I was facing was Buzz buzz buZZ.
            </p>
            <p>
                What I needed to do was get rid of the word ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù regardless of capitalization in the sentence [Buzz
                BUzz BuZZ help BUZZ buzz]. I wanted to use the filter method to filter out all the buzzes so only the
                word ‚Äúhelp‚Äù will stay. But I got blocked by what to filter. For example, if you want to only look up
                meat when you do online grocery shopping, you put ‚ÄúMeat & Seafood‚Äù in the filter. And you will only see
                products that meet the condition you put in which are meat and seafood on your web page. I understood
                the result I wanted to get and the method I needed to use, but I was lost in finding the connection
                between them.
                The aha moment was when I read the error message or the message that told me what was expected and what
                was the result of my code. It told me the outcome was ‚Äúbuzz buzz buzz buzz buzz‚Äù. So I got it
                immediately that I was doing the opposite thing. I put ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù in the filter, so only ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù stayed. I
                changed the condition in the filter that was everything that doesn‚Äôt equal ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù.

            </p>
            <p>
                I was lost in the logic flow and didn‚Äôt see the whole picture. What I learned here is to do it step by
                step, and find out what went wrong. Knowing the method used to solve the problem is not everything. I
                also need to know working theory and use reverse thinking. The feedback is essential as well. Just like
                the doctor can only help their patients when knowing what kind of disease they are tackling.

            <h3>
                ¬∑ Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem-solving techniques and process:
            </h3>
            <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
            <p>
                Pseudocode is an informal language that programmers use to create an outline or a rough draft of a
                program.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used it to be clear about what needs to be tackled and the methods and steps that will lead me to it.
            </p>
            <h4>Trying something</h4>
            <p>
                Problem-solving is about trying something out. I constantly try different methods and ways to get the
                code working. It is a good way to practice and know what works and what doesn‚Äôt. And most importantly
                why.
            </p>
            <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
            <p>
                The method is referred to as a think-aloud protocol. Programmers explain the problem out loud to get your
                brain into problem-solving mode. When they talk to a rubber duck, they can get a better idea of their
                thought processes and gain a deeper understanding of their work.
            </p>
            <h4>Reading error messages
            </h4>
            <p>
                The error messages are helpful to spot the problem and show a direction into solving it. I didn‚Äôt notice
                it until I found how useful it is during the buzz problem. </p>
            <h4>Console.logging</h4>
            <p>
                Console.logging allows programmers to read the code on a web page and therefore help to test the written
                code.
            </p>
            <h4>Googling</h4>
            <p>
                You can almost google everything, and get millions of answers. It is important that you know which one
                will suit the problem you encounter the most. Again, it is not about getting the answer, it‚Äôs to know
                how and why it resolved the problem.
            </p>
            <h4>Asking your peers for help
            </h4>
            <p>
                It is always nice to get support from people who work on the same project as you. They might know the
                answer to it or have excellent ideas.
            </p>
            <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
            <p>
                I often ask myself whether I can still solve the same problem without the answer and what are other
                methods I can use to improve my problem-solving skills. The most important thing is to make sense of the
                process and apply it to the problems you encounter.
