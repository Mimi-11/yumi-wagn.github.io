            <h2>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h2>
            <h3>¬∑ What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>

            <p>
                The term ‚Äúneuroplasticity‚Äù (or ‚Äúbrain plasticity‚Äù) refers to the ability of our brains to reorganize,
                both physically and functionally, throughout our lives, due to our environment. In short, it refers to
                the brain‚Äôs ability to change itself.
            </p>
            <h3>¬∑ Principles of Neuroplasticity and Why it is important</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Use It or Lose It</li>
                <p>
                    Failure to drive specific brain functions can lead to functional degradation.
                </p>
                <li>Use It and Improve It</li>
                <li>Specificity</li>
                <li>Repetition</li>
                <li>Intensity Matters</li>
                <li>Time Matters</li>
                <li>Salience Matters</li>
                <li>Age Matters</li>
                <li>Transference </li>
                <li>Interference</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Understanding the principles allowing us to be confident about improving the brain‚Äôs ability into
                engaging and acquiring know knowledge and experience. It challenges the limits we set for ourselves or
                by society. To use the brain and challenge yourself frequently, you will find out how powerful your
                brain is, and there are so many things we can achieve that we did not dare to believe.
            </p>
            <h3>¬∑ What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
            <p>
                Constantly learning and absorbing new information and knowledge. Always use my brain and expose myself
                to an information-rich environment. The stimulation of all kinds of activities can strengthen neural
                connections over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Repete and stick to it. When I just started learning Japanese, the word ‚Äúsunflower‚Äù was so difficult for
                me. So I repeated it around a hundred times. And now I can never forget it even I stopped learning the
                language for 5 years. Frequently and consistently Practicing is the key.
            </p>

            <h3>¬∑ What is Growth Mindset?</h3>
            <p>
                a growth mindset is that Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good
                strategies, and input from others).
            </p>

            <p>
                People with a growth mindset are more likely to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those
                who believe their talents are innate gifts). A ‚Äúgrowth mindset‚Äù thrives on challenge and sees failure
                not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our
                existing abilities.
            </p>
            <h3>¬∑ Inspiration of Growth Mindset?</h3>
            <p>
                In order to do everything perfectly and not make any mistakes, I sometimes avoid doing it from the
                beginning. As there is no such thing, there is no failure. But failure is not the end. It is just
                another challenge and a great moment to reflect on for further exploration and development. Be brave and
                dare to be wrong is something I will put in practice.
            </p>
            <h3>¬∑ How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>
                Always believe in myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don‚Äôt get intimidated by the difficulties.
            </p>
            <p>
                Never give up.
            </p>
            <p>
                Welcome challenges and feedbacks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make peace with failure.
            </p>
            <h3>¬∑ Blend with your learning plan and strategies?</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of feeling stressed, think that it is normal when learning new things. Just like the muscle sore
                after training, it let you know you are doing the right thing. Face the challenges and the unknown, soon
                they will be my strong armor and shield.
            </p>
